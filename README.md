These are some miscillaneous algorithms from experiments I was running in my free time and from classes. It's too bad that I
can't show off the more interesting stuff I've worked on -- especially the more creative and non-vanilla algorithms 
that I've done for companies-- but hopefully this gives some proof that I'm capable.
